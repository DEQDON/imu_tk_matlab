# imu_tk_matlab
Matlab scripts of David Tedaldi's ICRA14 paper, a robust and easy to implement method for IMU calibrationã€‚

It is a deterministic calibration method for a low cost IMU. The estimated parameters include biases, scale factor, and misalignment of the 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope.

The corresponding C++ implementation is [here](https://bitbucket.org/alberto_pretto/imu_tk).
